# Android Learning Projects (2019–2021)

This repository is a **personal archive of Android projects** that I developed while **learning Android development** between 2019 and 2021.  

From simple tests to comprehensive applications, every project in this repository reflects a stage in my learning process. I gained a better understanding of **Android fundamentals, UI/UX design, RecyclerViews, multi-language support, QR code integration, app usage statistics, and more** thanks to these projects.  

>  Note: These projects were developed as a **learning exercise**. Some projects were created and tested locally during 2019–2021 and uploaded here in 2026 for review and portfolio purposes.
